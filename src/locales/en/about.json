We always find ways to show our commitment to our customers and to our food.<br /><br />Our story began more than 12 years ago, when two brothers began to realize their old dream, to become the best in the field of catering, namely in cooking Lavash. So, in 2010, the first branch of Oqtepa Lavash appeared. Up to date, more than 55 fast food cafes have been opened throughout Uzbekistan and have provided jobs for more than 1,500 employees.<br /><br />Oqtepa Lavash Head Office<br />Address: <a href='https://yandex.com/maps/10335/tashkent/?ll=69.243903%2C41.333189&mode=poi&poi%5Bpoint%5D=69.242955%2C41.333130&poi%5Buri%5D=ymapsbm1%3A%2F%2Forg%3Foid%3D84095329958&z=18.84' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer'>Karasaray street, 2A.</a><br />Schedule: Mon-Fri 09:00 - 18:00"
